# Data-Mining-R-Project
Prediction of customer purchase behavior for the Black Friday Sale 

The dataset contains data from a retail store that would like to understand the purchasing habits of their customers so that they can offer a personalized list of products that would interest their customers. We impute the missing data and perform EDA. We use machine learning in order to build a prediction model that will predict a customers purchase amount. A list of machine learning models is compiled and built using tenfold repeated cross validation with three repeats. These models include a glm model, a glmnet model, a linear regression model, a GBM model and a treebag model. The model that produced the best median RMSE was the gbm model. This model produced a median RMSE of 3002.142. In order to increase sales, there are two possible solutions. First to market the products to the part of the demographic that doesnâ€™t shop at the given retail store. The second to market products to the part of the demographic that buys the products based on their purchase history and future purchase predictions.
